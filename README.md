# Memory-game
first, I want to Thank Yitzhak Pozailov my partner for that game
we develop it together

good to read before analyzing the code:
1. All the .ejs files are located in Views directory
2. The game has 12 pairs of cards, we gave the admin permission to play with less pairs
3. The logic implemented in script.js, pay attention fot flip() function that take
the back photo and transited it to the back side, which is Invisible, so the front photo
becsme visible
4. have fun!
